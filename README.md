# Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Restaurant Trends
During my internship as a Data Analyst at Cognifyz Technologies, an exploratory data analysis was performed on a global dataset comprising over 9,500 restaurants and 21 attributes. Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, insights were extracted on cuisine trends, price distributions, geographic concentrations, and customer behavior. It was found that North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food dominate globally, while online delivery correlates with higher customer ratings. A detailed analysis revealed that restaurants in cities like New Delhi and Quezon City consistently outperform others in terms of volume and ratings. Strong positive correlations were identified between review length, votes, and aggregate ratings. The findings have been visualized and translated into actionable recommendations to guide culinary businesses in service optimization, pricing strategy, and customer engagement.


# Conclusion
**From the analysis, several key insights were discovered:**

- Cuisine Trends: North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food are the top three cuisines, with over 64.8% of restaurants serving at least one of them. Only 2.46% serve all three.

- Geographic Concentration: Most restaurants are located in India (especially New Delhi) and the USA, with New Delhi alone contributing over 5,400 restaurants.

- Ratings & Delivery: Restaurants that offer online delivery have a higher average rating (3.25) compared to those without (2.46). The highest ratings are found in cities like Inner City and Quezon City.

- Price Range: Over 46% of restaurants fall into the lowest price range. Higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer table booking, while online delivery is most common at mid-range (price range 2).

- Customer Feedback: There is a strong positive correlation between:

> - Aggregate rating and review length (ρ = 0.618)

> - Aggregate rating and votes received (ρ = 0.86)

- Cuisine Combinations: Popular pairs like North Indian & Chinese dominate in frequency, while combinations like Ramen & Sushi and Börek & Desserts yield higher average ratings.

- Global Spread: Although restaurants are globally distributed, the highest concentrations are found in India, USA, Canada, and Australia.creases.

## **Recommendation**
Based on the insights:

1. Target Cuisine Trends: Food businesses expanding in India or the USA should consider offering North Indian, Chinese, or Fast Food items to align with demand.

2. Focus on Online Services: Since online delivery correlates with higher ratings, restaurants should invest in optimizing their online delivery experience to attract and retain customers.

3. Encourage Review Engagement: Higher review counts and longer reviews correlate with better ratings. Incentivizing customer feedback could enhance visibility and trust.

4. Price-Related Strategies:

> * Lower-priced restaurants should leverage online delivery as a core service.

> * Higher-priced restaurants should offer table booking to maintain customer expectations.

5. Data Coverage Expansion: The current dataset is biased toward a few countries. A more globally diverse dataset would enable more inclusive and representative analysis in future projects.
